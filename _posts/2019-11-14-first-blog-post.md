Pre-compiling CSS is more practical becuse you can use a variable for a specific color and reuse it whenever you need it for example. You can also make a variable for heigth,width etc. The preprocessed language offers you the possibility to use variables, nesting, mixins and more. So there will be less reapeated code. <br>
