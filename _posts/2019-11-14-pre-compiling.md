Pre-compiling CSS is more practical becuse you can use a variable for a specific color and reuse it whenever you need it for example. You can also make a variable for heigth,width etc. The preprocessed language offers you the possibility to use variables, nesting, mixins and more. So there will be less reapeated code. <br>

# Which techniques did you use? 

I have used variables for my some of my colors and I have used nestling in my SCSS.

# Pros and cons?

I think there are more pros then cons with pre-compiled CSS. It reduces the typing of code because you can reuse it in variables and don't breake the DRY principle. There is a problem debugging because the code line-numbers are not same in the source code.
