I have used Jekyll who is a Static Site Generator and I think it is really good. Because it is easier to organize the structure when you have separated diffrent parts of the website. Like having a footer document were you can write all the content and then input it in the default.html. The same goes for head,header and a lot more. Static sites are developed locally which makes it easy to preview and test, without changing the live website that you are currently building. SSG have also good preformance, security and are easy to use.

  **What type of projects are they suitable for**?

 Static site generators are good for blogging websites because the content stays the same with every visitor. SSG is better to use on smaller websites because if there are many diffrent editors they may need access to the Git repo or shared folders. Also real-time updates would require the site to be rebuilt and tested there for it would be delayed.
